It adjoined a block of flats and shops and was used, for the most part under rights granted by their leases, for car parking and waste bins by the tenants. One part was fenced off with the common parts of the flats and had been used as a drying area by the tenants but was now derelict. The car parking area had been tarmaced by the Applicant in 1985 when the development was built but had been neglected since then and was open to the road. The newly registered proprietor sold the land with the adjoining building to the Respondent in 2009, and the transfer was registered. The Respondent cleared and fenced the land, but was immediately met with protests from the tenants and the Applicant. The fencing was then removed and pending resolution of the dispute as to ownership the land was used for parking by all parties and continued to be used for the residential tenants’ bins. Most of the tenancies were on long leases without any rent being payable. There were two flats let on assured shorthold tenancies. Held: 1. The Respondent was not in possession of the land for the purposes of paragraph 6 of Schedule 4 to the Land Registration Act 2002. 2. The Applicant was in actual occupation of the fenced off drying area in a manner that should have been obvious to the Respondent on a reasonably careful inspection, so that the Respondent’s registered title was subject to the Applicant’s interest by virtue of paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 to the Land Registration Act 2002 and the Applicant was entitled to have the register altered to remove that land from the Respondent’s title.

If the Applicant was in actual occupation of the remainder of the land, it was not in such a way that would have been obvious on a reasonably careful inspection. 4. The Applicant was not in receipt of any rents or profits relating to the disputed land and was not therefore entitled to rely on the transitional provisions in paragraph 8 of Schedule 12 to the Land Registration Act 2002 which, if applicable, would have meant that the Respondent’s title to the whole of the disputed land would have been subject to the Applicant’s rights. 5.

REF/2009/1459||Knights Construction (March) Limited||(1) Roberto Mac Limited (2) The Chief Land Registrar||Mr Michael Mark||09/02/2011||Alteration and rectification of the register||Human Rights||On voluntary first registration in 2007, the land registered by mistake included land the paper title to which was vested in the Applicant. It adjoined a block of flats and shops and was used, for the most part under rights granted by their leases, for car parking and waste bins by the tenants. One part was fenced off with the common parts of the flats and had been used as a drying area by the tenants but was now derelict. The car parking area had been tarmaced by the Applicant in 1985 when the development was built but had been neglected since then and was open to the road. The newly registered proprietor sold the land with the adjoining building to the Respondent in 2009, and the transfer was registered. The Respondent cleared and fenced the land, but was immediately met with protests from the tenants and the Applicant. The fencing was then removed and pending resolution of the dispute as to ownership the land was used for parking by all parties and continued to be used for the residential tenants’ bins. Most of the tenancies were on long leases without any rent being payable. There were two flats let on assured shorthold tenancies. Held: 1. The Respondent was not in possession of the land for the purposes of paragraph 6 of Schedule 4 to the Land Registration Act 2002. 2. The Applicant was in actual occupation of the fenced off drying area in a manner that should have been obvious to the Respondent on a reasonably careful inspection, so that the Respondent’s registered title was subject to the Applicant’s interest by virtue of paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 to the Land Registration Act 2002 and the Applicant was entitled to have the register altered to remove that land from the Respondent’s title. Epps v Esso Petroleum, [1973] 1 WLR 1071, Abbey National Building Society v Cann, [1991] AC 56, Malory Enterprises Ltd v Cheshire Homes (UK) Ltd, [2002] Ch 216 and Link Lending Ltd v Bustard, [2010] EWCA Civ 424 applied. 3. If the Applicant was in actual occupation of the remainder of the land, it was not in such a way that would have been obvious on a reasonably careful inspection. 4. The Applicant was not in receipt of any rents or profits relating to the disputed land and was not therefore entitled to rely on the transitional provisions in paragraph 8 of Schedule 12 to the Land Registration Act 2002 which, if applicable, would have meant that the Respondent’s title to the whole of the disputed land would have been subject to the Applicant’s rights. 5. Insofar as the register was not altered to remove the land from the Respondent’s title, the rights of the tenants over would survive only insofar as they fell within the provisions of paragraph 3 of Schedule 3 or paragraph 9 of Schedule 12 to the Land Registration Act 2002. Nevill Long v Firmenich & Co, (1984) 47 P & CR 59 considered 6. The Applicant was entitled to have the registered title rectified to exclude the land which had been included in error, there being no exceptional circumstances which should lead to the power to rectify not being exercised.

To do this the Applicant would climb over a wall at the end of the courtyard behind the house which was sufficiently high to require either some athleticism or the use of steps. Between 1985 and 1996 the field was found to be surrounded by an electric and pig wire fence erected by a licensee under a grazing agreement each spring and taken down in late autumn each year. While it was there, the route could only be accessed at either end by climbing through or over the fence and throwing the dog over or through it, moving the upper strand of fencing to get through. Access was obtained from the roadway through a hole in the hedge about 2 to 3 feet wide and access to and from the house was by climbing over a wall which required steps or some athleticism to get over. The wall, which was the property of the Applicant, had once had an opening onto the field but it had been filled in by a friend of the Applicant in about 1985. The Applicant’s occasional use of the route, which was held to be on foot and occasionally with a wheelbarrow, left no visible track and the wall appeared to the casual onlooker to suggest that there was no access to the house from the field. The evidence was that the trustees had no actual knowledge of the use of the route. The route had been fenced off in July 2008, but this had been protested and early in 2009 the Applicant applied to the Land Registry to register a right of way with vehicles. That application was referred to the Adjudicator, the reference being received by him on 13 August 2009. Held: 1. The fencing had not been acquiesced in for over a year prior to the suit before the Adjudicator. The objections and the application to the Land Registry meant that a right under the Prescription Act 1832 could be claimed on appropriate evidence notwithstanding the obstruction. Davies v Du Paver, [1953] QB 184, CA, applied. 2. The circumstances of the user were such that the owners of the field and the occupier under the grazing licence had no actual or constructive knowledge of the user and that therefore no right of way by prescription could have arisen. Dalton v Angus (1880-1881) 6 App. Cas. 740 at 773-4, Hollins v Verney (1884) 13 QBD 304, CA, Pugh v Savage, [1970] 2 QB 373, CA, Diment v NH Foot Ltd. [1974] 1 WLR at 1433B-D and Williams v Sandy Lane (Chester) Ltd [2007] 1 P & CR 27, CA, considered and applied. Question whether the lifting or lowering of the top strand of the wire to get through or over the fence amounted to force so as to prevent any right of way arising in any event. 3. The claim to a right of way by necessity or under the doctrine of non-derogation from a grant were misconceived in the absence of any evidence of either necessity or a grant by the servient owner.||http://www.ahmlr.gov.uk/Judgments/j282/2009-1013%20Brown%20v%20Collins%20decision.doc||Easements and profits a prendre||Prescription, requirements and acquisition

At the same time it entered into assured shorthold tenancies of 10 years with the vendors at a rack rent with the vendors having the right to a further tenancy at the end of the 10 years. The vendors sought to protect their rights in respect of the 30 per cent balance by registering a notice against the freehold title at the Land Registry. The Administrators of the Applicant sought to have the notices cancelled. Held: 1. Where a vendor is to be paid part of the purchase price on completion and the balance at a later date no unpaid vendor’s lien arises in the absence of specific provision for one: Winter v Lord Anson, (1823) 1 Sim & St. 434; Clarke v Royle, (1830) 3 Sim.499; Buckland v Pocknell, (1843) 13 Sim.406; Earl of Jersey v Briton Floating Dock Co., (1869) LR 7 Eq 409; Re Albert Life Insurance Co., (1870) LR Eq 164; Re Brentwood Brick & Coal Co., (1876) LR 4 Ch D 562; Capital Finance v Stokes, [1969] 1 Ch 262. 2. Even where an unpaid vendor’s lien would otherwise arise by implication, it can be excluded by express provision in the sale contract: Qayoumi v Oakhouse Property Holdings plc, [2003] 1 BCLC 352. 3. The provisions in the contracts in the present test cases which provide that there is to be no unpaid vendor’s liens do not fall foul of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contract Regulations 199: UK Housing Alliance v Francis, [2010] EWCA Civ 117; Director General of Fair Trading v First National Bank plc, [2001] 1 AC 481; Office of Fair Trading v Abbey National plc, [2010] 1 AC 696. 4. No facts have been established in any of the three test cases dealt with in this decision which could give rise to any constructive trust or estoppel which could have arisen either prior to or at the time that the Applicant went into administration or as a result of the administration. 5. In any event, it is not possible to have a remedial constructive trust or equity by way of estoppel which arises in the course of the administration of a company: Re Polly Peck Internations plc (in administration) (No.2), [1998] 3 All ER 812. 6. There is no right of set off of rent or other payments due to the Applicant under tenancy agreements granted to the vendors at the time of the sales against the outstanding balance of the purchase price except insofar as such right may arise in the course of the administration or liquidation of the Applicant. In particular there is no right of set off against a third party to whom the property has been sold on by the Applicant: Edlington Properties Limited v Fenner & Co. Limited, [2006] 3 All ER 1200. 7. The contingent right to receive the balance of the purchase price at the end of 10 years does not affect a registered estate or charge within the meaning of section 32 of the Land Registration Act 2002. 8. Accordingly no notice in respect of that right can be registered at the Land Registry to protect the right and the notices so registered must be vacated.||http://www.ahmlr.gov.uk/Judgments/j368/2011.0604%20and%20others%20UK%20Housing%20Alliance%20v%20Bowyer%20and%20others%20decision.doc||Contracts and options||Contracts for sale
